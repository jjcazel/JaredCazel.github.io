# Portfolio Website

Welcome to the repository for my portfolio website, a showcase of my experience, projects, and the tools I use to create impactful software solutions. Visit the live site at [jaredcazel.com](https://jaredcazel.com).

## About the Site

This portfolio is built with HTML, CSS, jQuery, and Vanilla JS, emphasizing a foundational approach to front-end development. The design is simple and minimalist, focusing on content and usability without the use of modern frameworks. It features a parallax background effect, a lightbox gallery powered by Poptrox, and various pre-styled elements.
